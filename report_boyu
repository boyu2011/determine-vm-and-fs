Assignment 3Bo Yu (boyu2011@gmail.com)1. Determine virtual memory characteristicsStrategy:Define an integer array for simulate pages. Access pages and detect page fault. When a page fault happens, trace back the pages in order to get other page faults. Using these patterns, to determine which replacement algorithm is being used.According to investigation, we can conclude that the page replacement is not FIFO, and it is likely Second-Chance algorithm. 2. Determine file system characteristics2.1 Seek time for the local disk on linux-lab machines.Strategy:Create a file with a mount of bytes, reposition the offset of the file and measure the time.2.2 Disk bandwidth for the local disk on linux-lab machines.Strategy: Create an empty file, write amount of bytes into the file, and measure the time that used. According the definition of disk bandwidth, calculate the value equals TRANSFERRED_BYTES / TIME.Experiment result: Disk Bandwidth = 8.366766e+02 (byte/sec)
